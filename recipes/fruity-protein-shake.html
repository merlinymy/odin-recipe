        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            This protein shake combines the natural sweetness of fruit with the power-packed protein you need, without added sugars or fats. It's designed to be both refreshing and nourishing, providing essential nutrients and a boost of protein to support muscle recovery and energy levels. Made with a base of Greek yogurt for creaminess and a mix of berries for antioxidant benefits, this shake is not only flavorful but also incredibly wholesome. A touch of vanilla extract and optional spices like cinnamon can add depth to the flavor profile, making it a delightful treat at any time of the day.

                1 cup mixed berries (fresh or frozen, such as strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries)
            </li>
            <li>
                1/2 banana (for natural sweetness and creaminess)

                1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional, for added flavor)
            </li>
            <li>
                Ice (adjust quantity based on desired thickness)
            </li>
            <li>

                        If you're using fresh berries, wash them thoroughly. For frozen berries, there's no need to thaw them as they help to chill the shake.

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Braised oxtail is a rich, hearty dish known for its deep flavors and tender 
        meat that effortlessly falls off the bone, encapsulating the essence of comfort food.
         This delicacy begins with oxtails that are meticulously browned to perfection, 
         locking in an unparalleled depth of flavor. They are then slow-cooked in a 
         savory broth infused with red wine, which not only tenderizes the meat 
         but also melds with the juices to create a sauce of complex, layered tastes. 
         Root vegetables and aromatic herbs, such as thyme and bay leaf, contribute 
         earthy undertones and freshness to the dish, enhancing its robust character. 
         The slow braising process allows the meat's gelatinous qualities to shine, 
         resulting in a lusciously thick sauce. Served over a bed of creamy mashed 
         potatoes or with crusty bread on the side, braised oxtail offers a comforting, 
         soul-warming experience with every bite, making it a cherished recipe in 
         cuisines around the globe.

        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil or vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 carrots, peeled and chopped</li>
        <li>2 celery stalks, chopped</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>3 to 4 cups beef broth (enough to nearly cover the oxtails)</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>A few sprigs of fresh thyme (or 1 teaspoon dried thyme)</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>Prep and Brown the Oxtails:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 325°F (163°C).</li>
                <li>Season the oxtails generously with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>In a large oven-proof pot or Dutch oven, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the oxtails in batches and brown them on all sides. This should take about 2-3 minutes per side. Once browned, remove the oxtails and set them aside.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Sauté the Vegetables:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    In the same pot, reduce the heat to medium. Add the onions, carrots, and celery. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are softened, about 5 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add the minced garlic and cook for another 1-2 minutes, until fragrant.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Deglaze the Pot:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Pour in the red wine, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon. Allow the wine to simmer and reduce slightly, about 3-4 minutes.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Braise the Oxtails:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Return the oxtails to the pot. Add enough beef broth to nearly cover the oxtails. Toss in the bay leaves and thyme sprigs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bring the liquid to a simmer, then cover the pot with a lid. Transfer the pot to the preheated oven and braise for about 3 hours. The oxtails are done when they are very tender and the meat easily separates from the bone.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>

                Final Touches and Serving:
            </b>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Carefully remove the pot from the oven. You can serve the oxtails as they are, or for a smoother sauce, remove the oxtails, strain the vegetables and herbs out of the broth, and skim off any excess fat from the surface. Then, reduce the sauce over medium heat to your desired consistency and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Serve the oxtails with the sauce poured over them. Garnish with freshly chopped parsley. This dish goes wonderfully with mashed potatoes, creamy polenta, or crusty bread to soak up the rich sauce.

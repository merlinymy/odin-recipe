    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Twice-Cooked Pork, or Hui Guo Rou, is a classic Sichuan dish renowned for its rich flavors and contrasting textures. This iconic dish involves a two-step cooking process that begins with boiling pork belly slices to tender perfection, followed by stir-frying with vibrant vegetables and a bold, spicy sauce. The pork belly emerges incredibly tender on the inside with a delightfully crisp exterior, smothered in a sauce that's the perfect balance of savory, sweet, and spicy, courtesy of ingredients like fermented black beans, chili bean paste, and sweet bean paste. Served alongside or on top of steamed rice, Twice-Cooked Pork is a deeply satisfying dish that brings the complexity and heat of Sichuan cuisine to your table.</p>

                    <p>Place the pork belly in a pot and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for about 20-30 minutes, until the pork is just tender but not falling apart. Remove from heat, drain, and let the pork cool. Once cool, slice into thin pieces.</p>

                Stir-Fry the Pork:
            </b>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Heat the cooking oil in a wok or large frying pan over medium-high heat. Add the pork slices in batches, stir-frying until they start to brown and crisp on the edges. Remove the pork and set aside.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>

                Cook the Vegetables:
            </b>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>In the same wok, add a bit more oil if needed. Stir-fry the garlic and ginger until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the leek and red bell pepper, stir-frying for another minute.</p>

                    <p>
                        Return the pork to the wok with the vegetables. Pour the sauce over the pork and vegetables, mixing well to ensure everything is coated evenly. Stir-fry for another 2-3 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together and the sauce to slightly thicken.
